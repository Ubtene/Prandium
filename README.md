Prandium
====================

A Random Meal Planner
---------------------

Prandium is a latin word for meal which is what our apps sole focus is. It is a one stop shop
for a user to generate meals for a week. Not everyone has the time to plan out their meals a-
head of time. Our app takes that into consideration and outputs twenty-one meals for each week.

Our app focuses on having a sleek UI/UX for a user to be able to choose their ingredients list 
and save the meal for subsequent weeks if need be. There is also a chance that the user will not
be able to commit to making the meal and for those days, our users can get recommendations on
where to eat out.
